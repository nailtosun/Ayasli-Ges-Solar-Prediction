# Ayasli Ges Solar Prediction
## To do list

### Journal
* Paper template added. Start writing. (In Process) 

### LSTM
* There are missing data at 2017, it should be solved and retrained. (In literature least MAPE %11)
* 5 minute resolution data trained MAPE < %4.5 Weird?

### Neural Network with multiclass architecture
* ROC and Confusion matrix figures? 
* Test result of the model

### Neural Network with one class
* Small MAE but weird outputs?

### Obtaining cloud-cover data with PI
* Configuration of PI and obtaining first photo (Done)
